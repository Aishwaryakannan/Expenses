Expenses
========

Overview
--------

* This is a test app.

* A simple app in node.js to enter our daily expenses details between our friends and see the cumulative status of the expenses we made.

* For example if you are a group of friends staying in a shared room. You can use this app to enter your daily expense details, which inturn will show you the overall expense details in a sortable/searchable table and it will also give you a overview status of the expenses you made for example. How much each one of you spent, how much the share for each, how much each one needs to give or get from others etc.

* In this app am using mongodb to store all the data.

* This is a simple test app which I developed to learn nodejs and mongodb.

* If any one interested can give me some feedback to improve this.
